            <h2>Capture the Flag Competitions</h2>
            <p>Cyber security competitions have been a great way to practice my skillsets in a realistic and hands-on situation where time constraints and accuracy matter.</p>
            <p>In these competitions, the thought of competing against others was scary at first. Learning to push past that initial fear enabled me to gain knowledge and insight that would otherwise have been lost. It uncovered weaknesses and skill gaps I possessed, helping me self-improve and fix my shortcomings.</p>
            <p>Pushing my ego aside and using the competition as a learning experience was of great benefit to my overall skillsets. Even though each competition I have climbed and progressed, I always strive to better and address each unanswered question that is encountered.</p>

            <h2 id="tracelabs">Trace Labs Global OSINT CTF</h2>
            <p>Trace Labs is a Not-For-Profit organization with the mission of crowdsourcing the collection of OSINT to generate new leads on missing persons cases to assist law enforcement.</p>
            <p>In the winter of 2021, I participated in Trace Labs' Global OSINT Search Party CTF 2021. The <a href="https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/search-party" target="blank">Trace Labs Search Party CTF</a> is a non theoretical, gamified effort that allows for the crowdsourcing of contestants to perform a single task: Conduct open source intelligence operations to help find missing persons.</p>
            <p>During the CTF, I assisted junior team members on how to structure OSINT data, decipher any usable information obtained within it, use AI facial recognition tools to verify missing persons' hidden social media accounts and photographs, and explain to them the importance of documenting and preserving the data.</p>
            <p>This information would then be passed to judges for approval and finally accepted by law enforcement agencies to aid in missing personâ€™s cases.</p>
            <p>Not only was it an opportunity to compete as a team with other skilled OSINT peers but to help fellow junior team members experience the satisfaction of compiling and submitting valid OSINT data that will directly help ongoing investigations for a good cause.</p>
            <p>This CTF was tough because it forced me to put my personal feelings about each investigation aside and focus on working as a team, mentoring the junior members, aid law enforcement investigations with pertinent data, to help find the children and other missing persons associated with abduction, human trafficking, and cold cases.</p>
